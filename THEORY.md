\## Informational Relativity and the Topology of Systemic Coherence

\### A Multi-Scale Framework for Autopoietic Identity



> \*\*Abstract\*\*

> Modern scientific paradigms frequently isolate physical, biological, and social phenomena into discrete disciplinary models. This paper introduces the \*\*Informational Relativity Theory (IRT)\*\*, which posits that systemic identity across all scales—from cellular networks to sociological macro-structures—is governed by a unified set of information-theoretic constraints. By treating physical and social realities as emergent properties of a high-dimensional informational substrate, we define "identity" not as a static label, but as an autopoietic invariant achieved through continuous entropy minimization. We propose four fundamental field constraints required for structural coherence, model an iterative algorithmic loop for state-space stabilization, and introduce a computational schema for measuring field curvature and epistemic inertia in distributed networks.

\### 1. Introduction: The Transduction Problem

Scientific inquiry is currently constrained by ontological siloing. Physics maps material dynamics, biology maps organic autopoiesis, and sociology maps collective behavior, yet a unified substrate linking these domains remains elusive. We propose that information, rather than localized matter or energy, constitutes the primary ontological substrate of complex systems (Wheeler 1990). The Informational Relativity Theory (IRT) serves as a transducer, allowing disparate disciplines to map their domain-specific mechanics onto a shared geometrical framework governed by coherence and resonance.



\### 2. The Informational Substrate and the Autopoietic Invariant

Within the IRT, the universe is modeled as a high-dimensional holographic substrate where localized entities are treated as nodes of coherent information (Susskind 1995). For any system to maintain a boundary between itself and its environment, it must continuously minimize informational "surprise" or variational free energy (Friston 2010).



We define systemic identity as a structural necessity for coherence. When a system successfully filters out structural contradiction, noise, and cognitive dissonance—defined here as \*\*epistemic entropy\*\*—what remains is a mathematically stable, persistent invariant.



\#### Equation 1: The Autopoietic Invariant

$$I = \\Sigma\_{V} - S\_{E}$$



\* \*\*$I$\*\*: Stable systemic identity

\* \*\*$\\Sigma\_{V}$\*\*: Verifiable empirical state

\* \*\*$S\_{E}$\*\*: Epistemic entropy



Systemic identity represents the ultimate state of dynamic coherence, achieved when a system's empirical, conceptual, and functional operators achieve sustained resonance.

\### 3. The Four Constraints of the Information Field

For any localized node or distributed network to achieve stable accretion and resist structural fragmentation, it must operate within four strict constraints of the information field (Ashby 1947):



| Constraint | Designation | Definition |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Epistemic Grounding\*\* | $C\_1$ | Mechanistic alignment with external environmental states. Failure leads to maladaptation. |

| \*\*Autopoietic Binding\*\* | $C\_2$ | The cohesive force ensuring disparate nodes maintain structural entanglement and continuity (Maturana \& Varela 1980). |

| \*\*Entropic Stability\*\* | $C\_3$ | The state of minimum internal entropy production, providing algorithmic predictability (Prigogine 1978). |

| \*\*Ergodic Expansion\*\* | $C\_4$ | The kinetic drive for state-space exploration, propelling identity into higher coherence basins. |

\### 4. Scale-Free Algorithmic Evolution

IRT posits a scale-free model of structural evolution (Barabási and Albert 1999). The drive toward structural coherence relies on an iterative, recursive algorithmic loop executed across all scales of complexity.



\* \*\*Micro-Scale (Biological Integration):\*\* A cellular signaling network operates as an "Identity Routing Table." It processes environmental inputs, aligns them with internal homeostatic baselines, and rejects dissonant signals to preserve cellular boundaries (Levin 2019).

\* \*\*Macro-Scale (Sociological Integration):\*\* A civilization or institutional network undergoes an isomorphic mathematical process. Through iterative phase-shifts, a collection of distributed individuals aligns conceptual and functional frameworks to coalesce into a \*\*Meta-Coordinated Agent (MCA)\*\*.



\### 5. Topological Mapping of Epistemic Inertia

Classical sociological modeling often relies on the statistical mechanics of random populations. IRT upgrades this to a rigorous calculus of topological geometry (Lewin 1951). 



By mapping the location, trajectory, and density of identities (represented by vector $I$), the system measures \*\*Epistemic Inertia\*\*—the structural drag created when systems resist coherence. The model identifies optimal topological pathways, or "coherence basins," enabling the deployment of localized stabilizing structures (\*\*Bridge Agents\*\*) to resolve semantic voids and guide the system out of epistemic friction (Pentland 2014).

\### 6. Computational Interface: The Diagnostic Schema

To transition IRT from a descriptive theoretical model to an executable computational architecture, we introduce a standardized JSON-based interface specification. 



This computational schema allows organizations and artificial networks to align disparate internal data silos. By routing operations through this diagnostic architecture, an institution or proto-AGI system can mathematically measure its internal structural cohesion and coherence against the four field constraints ($C\_1–C\_4$), ensuring that as the architecture scales, its operational lineage remains fundamentally aligned and stable.
